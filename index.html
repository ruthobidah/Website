     <p>My name is Ruth and welcome to my page. I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree in
     Economics,a subject a really loved and enjoyed and I am currently
     completing a masters degree in Computer Science, a field I consider
    absolutely fun and enjoyable! If my academic history is any indication,
     I love to take on challenges and learn new things.

  <h3>Titan Park</h3>
  <p>Spring 2017 - Summer 2017</p>
  <p>Titan Park application created with a very unique group of CSUF students. our team created for
    the GE Predix Hackathon for 2017 using the GE Predix API. The goal of the Hackathon
    was to create sustainable solutions for problem areas on our campuses where there were
    still inefficiencies.The final presentation was at the GE Headquaters
    in San Ramon. Our team included people with diverse skills and I worked
    on the design, UI, developing statistical models to be integrated in the application. Working
    with my GE team was a wonderful experience on team work and project planning</p>

    <p>Strategy Game about pirates and Conquest done with Pygame </p>
    <h4>Story</h4>
    <p>The player is the captain of the ship in Tides and Glory. The captain is
       an ambitious strategist starting his/her conquest of the sea, in hopes of
       making the grandest storied sea adventure for fame and glory. The only way
      the captain can reach such iconic level is to accumulate as much wealth as

      and leave a trail of notorious deeds</p>
