     <p>My name is Ruth and welcome to my page. I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree in
     Economics,a subject a really loved and enjoyed and I recently
     completed a masters degree in Computer Science, a field I consider
    absolutely fun and enjoyable! If my academic history is any indication,
     I love to take on challenges and learn new things.
     I sincerely hope you enjoy browsing my page and seeing my projects and
     hobbies and I hope to post more projects as time permits</p>

     <p>Game: Ecomerica</p>
     <p>For my graduate project, I set out to prove the concept that the best
       outcome in learning can be achieved with game based learning systems.To support
       my thesis, I developed an Economics game as an RTS civilization building
       game that emphasized the application of economic principles in gameplay while
       incorporating lessons and assessment.The code, presentation, and design document
        for the project can be found in the links below:</p>

  <h3>Titan Park</h3>
  <p>Spring 2017 - Summer 2017</p>
  <p>Titan Park application created with a very unique group of CSUF students. our team created for
    the GE Predix Hackathon for 2017 using the GE Predix API. The goal of the Hackathon
    was to create sustainable solutions for problem areas on our campuses where there were
    still inefficiencies.The final presentation was at the GE Headquaters
    in San Ramon. Our team included people with diverse skills and I worked
    on the design, UI, developing statistical models to be integrated in the application. Working
    with my GE team was a wonderful experience on team work and project planning</p>
