  <p>Application created with a very unique group of CSUF students. Titan Park was a
  parking application created for the GE Predix Hackathon for 2017 using the GE Predix API.
  The goal of the Hackathon was to create sustainable solutions for problem areas on our
  campuses where there are still inefficiencies.The final presentation was at the GE Headquaters
